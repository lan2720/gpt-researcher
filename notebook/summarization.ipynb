      "Dear Fellow Tesla Shareholders:\n",
      "\n",
      "We are writing to urge you to vote AGAINST the election of J.B. Straubel to the Tesla Board of Directors (the “Board”) on May 16th. Mr. Straubel has been nominated to replace independent director Hiro Mizuno. While we appreciate the contributions Mr. Straubel made as co-founder and long-time Chief Technology Ofﬁcer of Tesla, he is clearly a company insider and not an appropriate choice for a Board that already has a dearth of independence. At present, the Board has strong ties to CEO Elon Musk, with his brother, Kimbal Musk, and Ira Ehrenpreis and James Murdoch, who count themselves as his personal friends, serving as directors. Further, Tesla directors receive an extraordinary level of compensation from the company which risks further compromising the Board’s objectivity and willingness to challenge the CEO. Replacing an independent director with another insider risks exacerbating existing problems that seem to arise from such a clubby Board, including an overcommitted CEO, high CEO and director compensation, a weak pledging policy, an outspoken CEO whose comments are often at the expense of Tesla’s reputation, and a permissive tone-at-the-top that has allowed a long-simmering ethics crisis to fester.\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "We are part of a group of shareholders that is currently engaging Board Chair Robyn Denholm about many of the issues raised in this letter; we have requested dialogue about a comprehensive Board overhaul that replaces the non-independent directors with truly independent directors. While we wait for that engagement to take place, we were alarmed to see the Board moving in the opposite direction with Mr. Straubel’s nomination in the company’s most recent proxy statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Close personal and professional ties undermine the Board’s independence from CEO Musk.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Mr. Straubel is elected, in our estimation, at least 5 directors of Tesla’s 8-member Board will be non-independent, bringing the independence level down to a paltry 38%. Musk’s own brother sits on the Board, and Directors Ehrenpreis and Murdoch have longstanding personal ties to the CEO. In recent court testimony, Murdoch stated that he had attended Kimbal Musk’s wedding, dined with Kimbal Musk and his wife, and had invested in Space X. Murdoch described his friendship with Elon Musk as going back to at least 2006 and close enough that their families have vacationed together several times. Ehrenpreis was an early investor in Tesla, Space X, and The Boring Company, and recently testiﬁed that he has exchanged messages with Elon Musk with effusive notes like “love you man,” and that he gave the rights to the ﬁrst Model 3 to Musk as a birthday gift.1 We also note that there is some indication of a personal relationship between Director Joseph Gebbia, who joined the Board in 2022 and has yet to be elected by shareholders, and Elon Musk. It was widely reported that, in August 2018, Gebbia texted Musk regarding his tweet of plans to take Tesla private at $420 a share, calling it a “baller move,” to which Musk replied, “sucks being public.”2 Stacking the Board with friends and family creates potential conﬂicts of interest, which is problematic given the Board’s responsibility to oversee management and objectively represent the interests of all shareholders.\n",

      "Reducing Board independence exacerbates the Board’s existing weaknesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla’s Board is already overly deferential to CEO Musk as has been demonstrated by the complete lack of oversight in allowing Musk to be overcommitted in his business ventures. Currently, he divides his time as CEO of three companies (Tesla, SpaceEx, and Twitter) and as founder at two more (The Boring Company and Neuralink). Moreover, he recently announced that he is launching a third start-up, TruthGPT.\n",
      "\n",
      "While allowing Musk to be a part-time CEO, in 2018, the Board granted him a mega-compensation package that included a 10-year grant of stock options with 12 potential vesting tranches, now valued at up to $56B3 and causing a signiﬁcant dilution for shareholders. Shareholders have sued Musk and Tesla's Board, accusing them of breaching their ﬁduciary duties to the company and its shareholders by granting unjust enrichment to Musk and wasting corporate assets. The Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that Tesla’s CEO compensation award should be reviewed under “heightened judicial suspicion” due to the conﬂict of interest between the approval of the pay package and Musk’s status as a controlling shareholder.4 Musk’s compensation award is so massive, that the Economic Policy Institute had to exclude his pay from their most recent report because including his $23.5 billion worth of stock options exercised in 2021 in the sample “would have resulted in an increase of CEO pay in 2021 relative to 2020 of over 300% (the ‘average’ for the sample would have been just under $100 million).”5 In another sign of management capture, the Board did not step in when Musk reportedly pulled more than 50 employees, mostly software engineers, from Tesla to work at Twitter. Additionally, the Tesla Board has allowed Musk to pledge up to 25% of his Tesla stock as collateral for personal indebtedness, creating clear risks for Tesla shareholders. By contrast, according to Institutional Shareholder Services, over 90% of companies in the S&P 500 have adopted policies prohibiting pledging by company insiders, including outright bans of pledging by executives or directors (68%) or allowing pledging only subject to a waiver granted by the Board (22%). Finally, the Board has failed to rein in Musk’s taunts intended to provoke the SEC and divisive commentary, both of which pose risks for Tesla.\n",

Last year, market research ﬁrm YouGov reported that for the ﬁrst time the majority of survey respondents reported a negative view of Tesla’s brand. Since January 2020, YouGov’s brand reputation surveys have found that each major U.S. auto company has scored higher than Tesla. Surveys conducted by Morning Consult also revealed declining consumer sentiment for the Tesla brand. This\n",

      "decline was particularly sharp among Democrats, leading Morning Consult to conclude that “Tesla is on its way to becoming a partisan brand.”6 Over the past three years, Tesla has experienced extraordinary volatility in its share price and operational performance. After a meteoric rise during the COVID pandemic, Tesla’s share price has fallen 55% since November 2021. While it can be hard to attribute share price declines to any particular cause, many analysts and reporters have cited supply chain issues, the shutdown of Tesla’s factory in China, and several quarters of vehicle deliveries falling below expectations as explanations for this decline. Other commentators have suggested that Tesla shareholders have been concerned that Musk’s acquisition of Twitter may be distracting him from his responsibilities at Tesla, and further pointed to his having sold a substantial number of Tesla shares in order to ﬁnance that acquisition.7 In 2021, when Musk tweeted out a poll asking his followers if he should sell 10% of his interest in Tesla, shares fell as much as 7.3%. Shares also fell by 3% when Musk tweeted that there may be doubt in Hertz’s ability to purchase 100,000 Teslas as part of a previously announced arrangement. An independent board of directors is critical to managing these ﬂuctuations that make Tesla’s performance appear to be at the whim of Musk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla also suffers from a poor tone at the top which has created material legal risk for the company. For over a decade, accusations have surfaced of a toxic work environment at the Fremont factory. Elon Musk’s email following a 2017 class action lawsuit alleging racial discrimination and harassment telling employees that “if someone is a jerk to you, but sincerely apologizes, it is important to be thick- skinned and accept that apology”8 serves as an egregious example of setting a permissive tone by putting the weight of the transgression on the victim and signaling to the perpetrator that the misbehavior is ﬁne as long as you apologize. Meanwhile, the problem has only festered. In 2022, the California Department of Fair Housing and Employment ﬁled suit against Tesla after a 32-month investigation concluded that Black employees faced a hostile environment at the factory. Allegations include severe harassment wherein Black workers endure racist jokes and name-calling, swastikas and other racial epitaphs left on walls, and part of the factory being referred to as the plantation or slave ship. Last summer, a class action lawsuit was ﬁled on behalf of at least 15 Tesla current and former employees alleging the same issues at the same plant. In another example, at least 7 women have ﬁled suit against Tesla alleging sexual harassment since 2021. Last year, the CEO himself faced sexual harassment allegations at SpaceEx and tweeted “Finally, we get to use Elongate as scandal name. It’s kinda perfect,” with the laugh-cry emoji.9 These examples of Musk making light of discrimination and harassment accusations, set a permissive tone throughout the company allowing hostile work environments to thrive and creating material risk for Tesla, all of which have taken place under the oversight of a questionably independent Board.\n",

      "High director compensation further erodes independence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla directors receive extraordinary compensation, many times larger than what directors earn at other large companies, enabling them to amass fortunes over the years. This level of compensation risks discouraging directors from “rocking the boat,” especially considering the heavy inﬂuence Musk’s large equity stake in Tesla has in director elections. According to an examination of security ﬁlings by the New York Times in late 2022, Board Chair Denholm’s compensation, composed almost entirely of stock options, was $5.8 million in 2020, and she has earned $280 million since 2020 from the sale of Tesla shares awarded to her as compensation. The same analysis found that Murdoch received $11 million, mostly in stock options, since becoming a Tesla director in 2017, and estimated his stake in the company to be $200 million based on company securities ﬁlings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding Straubel to the Board is a step in the wrong direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Newly nominated J.B. Straubel has longstanding ties to Tesla and Elon Musk. They both joined Tesla early on and consider themselves co-founders. Straubel served under Musk as Tesla’s Chief Technology Ofﬁcer for 14 years. After resigning in 2019, he remained on as a “Senior Advisor” according to company disclosures. We note that it is unclear when he left this role, but presumably it was prior to May 2020 since Tesla asserts in its proxy statement that he is “independent” by NASDAQ standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "An excerpt from the recent derivative complaint ﬁled as part of a lawsuit over Elon Musk’s 2018 compensation plan raises serious concerns about Musk and Straubel’s relationship with the Board:\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 12, 2017, with discussions regarding the 2018 Grant ongoing, Tesla co-founder J.B. Straubel emailed E. Musk regarding “Equity Incentives,” and requested that E. Musk “consider giving [Straubel] the same vesting milestones that [E. Musk] and the board set up for [E. Musk] and tie to that some smaller percentage of the equity awards when they are achieved.” E. Muhk responded that he was “planning on something really crazy, but also high risk” vis-à-vis his new compensation plan.10 At the time, both Musk and Straubel were Named Executive Ofﬁcers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to be effective, the Tesla Board requires strong directors who have a proven ability to stand up to domineering founder-CEOs. Unfortunately, this does not seem to be Straubel’s strong suit. In an article with Time Magazine last year, Straubel responded to a question about his relationship with Musk:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some of this stuff is a lightning rod of controversy that I just do not want to wade into, frankly—I’m tiptoeing around how we even talk about this stuff. I know people are fascinated by [my relationship with Elon], but there’s no real beneﬁt in trying to thread the needle on this. You’ll risk ﬁnding a way to piss him off on something that you say, probably unintentionally, and then have him more frustrated at you, or who knows what.”11 Adding another insider who is likely to be acquiescent to CEO Musk will only serve to further dilute an already weak Board.\n",

Straubel进入董事会，原因是担忧董事会的独立性。该集团认为，用内部人士取代独立董事将加剧现有问题，包括高CEO和董事薪酬、薄弱的质押政策以及宽松的顶层氛围。如果Straubel当选，该集团估计特斯拉董事会只有38%的独立性。特斯拉董事会已经过于顺从CEO马斯克，没有对他在多家公司兼职的问题进行监督。此外，特斯拉董事会允许马斯克将其特斯拉股票的25%作为个人债务抵押品，给股东带来风险。特斯拉需要一个强大、独立的董事会来平衡马斯克的行为。此外，特斯拉在过去几年中股价波动巨大，部分原因可能与马斯克的行为有关。特斯拉还面临着来自员工的种族歧视和性骚扰指控，这些问题在现有董事会的监督下持续发酵。根据纽约时报2022年底的一项调查，董事会主席Denholm自2020年以来已通过出售作为报酬的特斯拉股票赚取了2.8亿美元，而Murdoch自2017年成为特斯拉董事以来获得了1100万美元的报酬，主要是股票期权。特斯拉董事会需要有能力对抗强势创始人CEO的独立董事，而Straubel似乎并不具备这种能力。他与马斯克的个人关系可能使他在董事会中缺乏独立性。因此，投资者呼吁反对J.B.
