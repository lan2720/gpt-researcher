    "① Tesla is scheduled to announce its third-quarter earnings report after the US stock market closes on Wednesday; ② After a series of price cuts and lower-than-expected third-quarter deliveries, investors are concerned about the company's profit margins and demand prospects; ③ Major Wall Street banks gave different predictions on this Q3 earnings report.\n",
    "$Tesla(TSLA.US)$The financial report for the third quarter of 2023 will be released after the US stock market on Wednesday. Investors are holding their breath waiting for this leading electric vehicle data update. Wall Street currently expects Tesla's Q3 revenue to be 24.9 billion US dollars, compared to 21.5 billion US dollars for the same period last year; adjusted earnings per share are expected to be 0.91 US dollars, compared to 1.05 US dollars for the same period last year.\n",
    "For now, in the third-quarter earnings report, Wall Street analysts are still most concerned about the company's gross margin level after several price cuts, as well as any comments or predictions on its demand prospects in the US and China.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the data, Tesla's gross margin in Q1 was 19.3%, down from 23.8% in Q4 last year, and fell further to 18.2% in Q2. Another price cut announced by Tesla earlier this month has once again raised investors' concerns about its profit margins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Morgan Stanley stock analyst Adam Jonas believes Tesla's Q3 gross margin may drop further to 17.5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "He said that investors are cautious about Tesla's performance for the rest of this year. At the same time, many investors don't know if Tesla can achieve profit growth next year. He also said that investors are “not very enthusiastic” about Tesla's electric pickup, the Cybertruck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gene Munster, a well-known technology analyst and executive partner of Deepwater Asset Management, pointed out that Tesla's Q3 earnings report will “all be about profit margins.”\n",
    "\n",
    "He said that operating margins are at the core of investors' debate over whether Tesla is an automobile company or a technology company. He believes Tesla's gross margin may decline again in Q3, but it may pick up in Q4.\n",
    "\n",
    "The electric car maker has previously published delivery data, with 435,059 vehicles delivered in the third quarter, falling short of Wall Street's expectations of 451,000 vehicles. Tesla said the shutdown of its Shanghai and Dallas plants led to a slight drop in car production this quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what Wall Street bosses have to say about Tesla's Q3 earnings report:\n",
    "\n",
    "US investment bank Wedbush: “After unstable delivery data, profit and guidance became the focus.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said that although Tesla's third-quarter deliveries fluctuated and disappointed investors, it believes the “outlook will be better” for the fourth quarter and 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a recent report, he said, “With the vast majority of price reduction actions over and factory shutdowns/upgrades completed, we believe gross margin will rise from current levels and reach a low point in the third quarter. A major topic in the conference call will be the Model 3 update and the overall demand trends Tesla is seeing around the world.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Wedbush has reaffirmed its “stronger than market” rating and $350 price target, which means the stock has 38% upside potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Royal Bank of Canada (RBC): “Tesla is like Netflix(Netflix).”\n",
    "\n",
    "RBC says Tesla is nearing a strategic fulcrum, just like$Netflix(NFLX.US)$Shifting from a low-profit DVD rental business to a high-profit streaming business is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bank wrote in its latest report, “Our view is that Tesla may be in the midst of a strategic shift from manufacturing automobiles to becoming a Tier 1 supplier. As for Tesla's strategic focus, we see charging infrastructure, batteries, and drive units as key to acquiring original equipment manufacturer (OEMs) customers.”\n",
    "\n",
    "RBC emphasized that if Tesla is to achieve its delivery target of 1.8 million vehicles in 2023, it must deliver 476,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "“This requires production to return quickly to normal levels.” According to the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "RBC has reaffirmed its “stronger than the market” rating and $305 target price, which means the stock has 20% upside potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "J.P. Morgan: “The modest mistake came after a drastic change in goals.”\n",
    "\n",
    "In a recent report, Komo said that compared to Wall Street analysts' predictions a year ago, Tesla's delivery mistakes in the third quarter were far greater. Analysts expect 485,000 vehicles to be delivered in the third quarter at the beginning of this year, and 550,000 vehicles in June 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Although this represents a significant reset in expectations, the decline in delivery prospects is actually the most meaningless of Tesla's expectations reset this year, as it occurred when the average selling price dropped sharply, which exacerbated the impact of insufficient sales volume on all other performance indicators.” The line added.\n",
    "\n",
    "J.P. Morgan has reaffirmed its “reduced holdings” rating and $135 target price, which means the company's stock price could fall 47%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goldman Sachs: Further price cuts are likely\n",
    "\n",
    "Goldman Sachs said in a report that Tesla investors may turn their attention to the anticipated Model 3 update and the impact of the Cybertruck (Cybertruck) launch on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "“To what extent will the new models help drive sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2024? According to the data, the consensus value for the fourth quarter was 499,000 vehicles, and 2.358 million vehicles for the full year of 2024. We expect this to increase to 494,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter and 2.275,000 vehicles in 2024.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The bank also emphasized that Tesla will benefit from lower costs in 2024, “although we think it may lower prices further to drive sales next year and slow the increase in profit margins.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Goldman Sachs rated Tesla as “neutral,” with a target price of $265 and a potential increase of 4%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bank of America: Lower Delivery and Price Reduction Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "Bank of America believes that investors' focus will be directly on Cybertruck upgrades, profit margins and the possibility of future price reductions, ongoing efforts to reduce costs, and comments on the demand for electric vehicles in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bank said, “We lowered our expectations for the third quarter to reflect lower deliveries than our previous forecasts and price changes for the current quarter.” The bank lowered its third-quarter earnings per share forecast from $0.75 to $0.65, while GAAP's earnings per share forecast was $0.78.\n",

       "# The Need for Independence: A Closer Look at Tesla's Board of Directors\n",
       "\n",
       "As experienced investors and advanced traders, it's crucial to stay informed about the inner workings of the companies we invest in. Today, we delve into the recent developments at Tesla, Inc., focusing on the composition of its Board of Directors and the implications for the company's governance.\n",
       "\n",
       "## The Controversy Surrounding Tesla's Board\n",
       "\n",
       "Recently, the SOC Investment Group, along with other investor advocates, issued a letter urging Tesla shareholders to vote against the election of J.B. Straubel to the Tesla Board of Directors. The primary concern is that Straubel, a co-founder and former Chief Technology Officer of Tesla, is considered a company insider, which could further compromise the already questioned independence of the Board.\n",
       "\n",
       "### The Issue of Board Independence\n",
       "\n",
       "The independence of a company's board is crucial for maintaining objectivity and the ability to challenge the CEO when necessary. However, Tesla's Board has been criticized for its strong ties to CEO Elon Musk. This includes personal relationships with directors such as Kimbal Musk (Elon's brother), Ira Ehrenpreis, and James Murdoch. \n",
       "\n",
       "If Straubel is elected, it's estimated that at least 5 of Tesla's 8-member Board will be non-independent, reducing the independence level to a mere 38%. This raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the Board's ability to effectively oversee management and represent the interests of all shareholders.\n",
       "\n",
       "### The Impact of CEO Influence\n",
       "\n",
       "Elon Musk's influence over Tesla is undeniable. However, his multiple roles as CEO of three companies (Tesla, SpaceX, and Twitter) and founder of two more (The Boring Company and Neuralink) have raised concerns about his ability to effectively manage his responsibilities. \n",
       "\n",
       "Moreover, Musk's controversial statements on Twitter and his involvement in various legal issues have negatively impacted Tesla's reputation and share price. An independent board of directors is critical to managing these fluctuations and ensuring that Tesla's performance isn't solely at the whim of Musk.\n",
       "\n",
       "### The High Director Compensation\n",
       "\n",
       "Another point of contention is the extraordinary compensation received by Tesla directors, which is significantly larger than what directors earn at other large companies. This level of compensation could discourage directors from challenging the status quo, further eroding the Board's independence.\n",
       "\n",
       "## The Case Against J.B. Straubel\n",
       "\n",
       "While J.B. Straubel's technical independence may meet NASDAQ standards, his personal history with Tesla and relationship with Musk make him a questionable choice for the Board. His addition could further dilute an already weak Board and hinder its ability to effectively oversee the company's operations.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "The independence of Tesla's Board is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. The addition of another insider to the Board could exacerbate existing problems and further compromise the Board's ability to effectively govern the company. As investors, it's crucial to stay informed about these developments and make our voices heard."

       "In a recent letter to Tesla shareholders, the SOC Investment Group urged shareholders to vote against the election of J.B. Straubel to the Tesla Board of Directors. Straubel, a co-founder and former Chief Technology Officer of Tesla, has been nominated to replace independent director Hiro Mizuno. The group argues that Straubel, being a company insider, is not an appropriate choice for a board that already lacks independence.\n",

They express concern about the board's move to nominate Straubel, which they see as a step in the wrong direction.\n",
       "\n",
       "## The Impact of Close Ties\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "## The Consequences of Reduced Independence\n",
       "\n",
       "The group believes that reducing board independence exacerbates the board’s existing weaknesses. They cite Musk's overcommitment to his business ventures, his massive compensation package, and his controversial statements on Twitter as examples of the board's lack of oversight.\n",
       "\n",
       "## The Importance of a Strong, Independent Board\n",
       "\n",
       "The group emphasizes the need for a strong, independent board to counterbalance Musk’s behavior. They point to Musk’s polarizing statements on Twitter and the negative impact they have on Tesla’s reputation. They also highlight the company's poor tone at the top, which they believe has created a hostile work environment and legal risk for Tesla.\n",

       "# The Need for Independence: A Closer Look at Tesla's Board of Directors\n",
       "\n",
       "As active traders, it's crucial to stay informed about the companies we invest in. Today, we delve into the recent developments at Tesla, Inc., focusing on the company's Board of Directors and the concerns raised by the SOC Investment Group.\n",
       "\n",
       "## The Controversy Surrounding Tesla's Board\n",
       "\n",
       "In a recent letter to Tesla shareholders, the SOC Investment Group urged shareholders to vote against the election of J.B. Straubel to the Tesla Board of Directors. Straubel, a co-founder and former Chief Technology Officer of Tesla, has been nominated to replace independent director Hiro Mizuno. The group argues that Straubel's close ties to the company and CEO Elon Musk make him an inappropriate choice for a Board that already lacks independence.\n",
       "\n",
       "### The Issue of Board Independence\n",
       "\n",
       "The SOC Investment Group argues that the Tesla Board's independence is compromised due to its strong ties to CEO Elon Musk. If Straubel is elected, at least five of Tesla's eight-member Board will be non-independent, reducing the independence level to a mere 38%. \n",
       "\n",
       "The group also highlights the extraordinary level of compensation Tesla directors receive, which they argue could compromise the Board's objectivity and willingness to challenge the CEO. \n",
       "\n",
       "### The Impact of CEO Elon Musk\n",
       "\n",
       "The group also raises concerns about Musk's influence on the company. They point to his overcommitment to multiple business ventures, his massive compensation package, and his controversial statements on Twitter as issues that could negatively impact Tesla's reputation and performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "### The Need for a Strong, Independent Board\n",
       "\n",
       "The group argues that Tesla requires a strong, independent Board to counterbalance Musk's behavior. They point to Tesla's volatile share price, operational performance, and allegations of a toxic work environment as evidence of the need for more independent oversight.\n",
       "\n",
       "## The Case Against J.B. Straubel\n",
       "\n",
       "The group argues that Straubel, despite being technically independent by listing standards, is a poor choice for the Board due to his personal history with Tesla and relationship with Musk. They believe that his addition to the Board would further dilute its already weak independence.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "The SOC Investment Group's letter highlights the importance of board independence in ensuring effective oversight and management of a company. For Tesla, the group argues that the Board's lack of independence has resulted in poor oversight of the company's influential and mercurial CEO, leading to numerous scandals that have negatively impacted Tesla's brand and operations.\n",
       "\n",
       "As active traders, it's crucial to consider these factors when making investment decisions. The independence and effectiveness of a company's Board can significantly impact its performance and reputation, making it a key consideration for any investor."

One of the key factors that contribute to these aspects is the governance of the companies we invest in. Today, we delve into the governance of one such company, Tesla Inc., and the concerns raised by the SOC Investment Group regarding the election of J.B. Straubel to the Tesla Board of Directors.\n",
       "\n",
       "## The Concerns Raised\n",
       "\n",
       "In a letter dated April 24, 2023, the SOC Investment Group urged fellow Tesla shareholders to vote against the election of J.B. Straubel to the Tesla Board of Directors. The group raised several concerns, including:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Lack of Board Independence:** The group argues that the Tesla Board already lacks independence, with strong ties to CEO Elon Musk. The addition of Straubel, a company insider, could exacerbate this issue.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **High Director Compensation:** The group points out that Tesla directors receive extraordinary compensation, which could discourage them from challenging the CEO.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **CEO Overcommitment:** The group criticizes the Board for allowing Musk to divide his time as CEO of three companies, potentially compromising his commitment to Tesla.\n",

       "- **CEO's Controversial Behavior:** The group highlights Musk's often polarizing and inflammatory statements on Twitter, which they argue have negative ramifications on Tesla’s reputation.\n",

       "## The Need for a Board Overhaul\n",
       "\n",
       "The SOC Investment Group is part of a group of shareholders currently engaging Board Chair Robyn Denholm about many of the issues raised in the letter. They have requested dialogue about a comprehensive Board overhaul that replaces the non-independent directors with truly independent directors.\n",
       "\n",
       "## The Risks of Reduced Board Independence\n",
       "\n",
       "The group argues that reducing Board independence exacerbates the Board’s existing weaknesses. They point to Musk's overcommitment to his business ventures, his massive compensation award, and his divisive commentary as evidence of this.\n",
       "\n",
       "## The Importance of a Strong, Independent Board\n",
       "\n",
       "The group emphasizes the need for a strong, independent Board to counterbalance Musk’s behavior. They argue that Musk's controversial statements and the permissive tone at the top have created material legal risk for the company.\n",
       "\n",
       "## The Issue with High Director Compensation\n",
       "\n",
       "The group raises concerns about the high compensation received by Tesla directors, arguing that it risks discouraging directors from challenging the CEO.\n",
       "\n",
       "## The Problem with Adding Straubel to the Board\n",
       "\n",
       "The group argues that adding Straubel, who has longstanding ties to Tesla and Elon Musk, to the Board is a step in the wrong direction. They believe that adding another insider who is likely to be acquiescent to CEO Musk will only serve to further dilute an already weak Board.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "The SOC Investment Group urges fellow shareholders to vote against the election of J.B. Straubel, citing the need for more independent directors on Tesla's Board. They argue that the current lack of board independence has resulted in poor oversight of the company’s overly influential and mercurial CEO, leading to numerous scandals that have been detrimental to Tesla’s brand and operations.\n",

       "- **High CEO and Director Compensation**: Musk's compensation package, valued at up to $56 billion, has been criticized for causing significant dilution for shareholders. The board's failure to challenge this compensation package suggests a lack of oversight.\n",

       "- **Weak Pledging Policy**: The board has allowed Musk to pledge up to 25% of his Tesla stock as collateral for personal indebtedness, creating clear risks for Tesla shareholders.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Controversial CEO Behavior**: Musk's polarizing statements on Twitter have negatively impacted Tesla's brand reputation. An independent board is critical to managing these fluctuations and ensuring the company's performance is not solely at the whim of the CEO.\n",
